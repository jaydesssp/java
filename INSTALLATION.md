# installation guide

follow these steps to install the **java modpack** properly for **minecraft 1.21** using **fabric loader 0.16.9**

---

### prerequisites

- **minecraft version**: 1.21
- **loader**: fabric 0.16.9
- **pojavlauncher** (if using mobile) or any fabric-compatible launcher on pc

> **note:** if you're on **PC**, I highly recommend using **X Launcher** for the best experience.  
X Launcher is lightweight, fast, and works seamlessly with fabric mods, offering great performance on both high and low-end PCs. Itâ€™s my top recommendation for running this modpack smoothly.
